It proposes a four-stage approach through which we can: - assess the type of crisis and initiate a response; - adapt to the new pace and start building sensing networks to inform decisions; - repurpose existing structures and working methods to generate radical innovation; - transcend the crisis, formalise lessons learnt and increase resilience. The guide stresses the importance of setting and managing boundaries, building informal structures, keeping options open, distributing engagement and keeping an ongoing assessment of the evolving landscape. Action items, real life examples and demonstrations complement the references to the developing theoretical framework.},

We describe the Cynefin framework, a sense-making device we have developed to help people make sense of the complexities made visible by the relaxation of these assumptions. The Cynefin framework is derived from several years of action research into the use of narrative and complexity theory in organizational knowledge exchange, decision-making, strategy, and policy-making. The framework is explained, its conceptual underpinnings are outlined, and its use in group sense-making and discourse is described. Finally, the consequences of relaxing the three basic assumptions, using the Cynefin framework as a mechanism, are considered. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Juarrero then proposes a new framework for conceptualizing causes based on complex adaptive systems. Thinking of causes as dynamical constraints makes bottom-up and top-down causal relations, including those involving intentional causes, suddenly tractable. A different logic for explaining actions - as historical narrative, not inference - follows if one adopts this novel approach to long-standing questions of action and responsibility."–BOOK JACKET.},

	abstract = {Order is a more or less explicit topic for any thinker who undertakes to write about nature. Even those who assert that randomness or chaos is the most fundamental trait of nature are obliged to account for the apparent permanence, organisation and structure we observe around us. No less is true for Gilles Deleuze, who champions the power of chaos through his work. On one reading, Deleuze's chief impulse is to wrench loose the lynchpins of order; to 'affirm chaos' and disarticulate the law of excluded middle; to refuse jurisdiction to laws of nature and render provisional its every constant; to banish identity and negation alike. If we are to be left with no fixed point, we might ask, what remains of order? This study is nevertheless an examination of that notion in Deleuze's natural philosophy. For me the counter-reading is much more productive and insightful. Deleuze is rather a firm believer in order, even there where he affirms chaos. If we could furnish a 'Deleuzian Question' par excellence, it would be; 'Given that there are no fixed points, how is order expressed in the world?' This question is implicitly reprised across the entirety of his work and inflected at each stage by fresh vocabulary coined to treat it anew, as though for each new Deleuzian territory a new phrasebook is required.},

Despite these related concerns, social and cultural studies have been almost entirely absent in discussions of the design of ubiquitous technologies. This essay seeks to introduce researchers in both fields to each other, and begin to explore the ways in which collaboration might proceed. By exploring mobile and ubiquitous technologies currently being used to augment our experiences of the city, this paper investigates notions of sociality, spatialization and temporalization as central to our experiences of everyday life, and therefore of interest to the design of ubiquitous computing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Experimental art deployed in the Augmented Reality (AR) medium is contributing to a reconfiguration of traditional perceptions of interface, audience participation, and perceptual experience. Artists, critical engineers, and programmers, have developed AR in an experimental topology that diverges from both industrial and commercial uses of the medium. In a general technical sense, AR is considered as primarily an information overlay, a datafied window that situates virtual information in the physical world. In contradistinction, AR as experimental art practice activates critical inquiry, collective participation, and multimodal perception. As an emergent hybrid form that challenges and extends already established 'fine art' categories, augmented reality art deployed on Portable Media Devices (PMD’s) such as tablets \& smartphones fundamentally eschews models found in the conventional 'art world.' It should not, however, be considered as inscribing a new 'model:' rather, this paper posits that the unique hybrids advanced by mobile augmented reality art–– also known as AR(t)–– are closely related to the notion of the 'machinic assemblage' ( Deleuze \& Guattari 1987), where a deep capacity to re-assemble marks each new art- event. This paper develops a new formulation, the 'software assemblage,’ to explore some of the unique mixed reality situations that AR(t) has set in motion.},

	abstract = {Imagine organising a birthday party for a group of young children. Would you agree a set of learning objectives with their parents in advance of the party? Would those objectives be aligned with the mission statement for education in the society to which you belong? Would you create a project plan for the party with clear milestones associated with empirical measures of achievement? Would you start the party with a motivational video so that the children did not waste time in play not aligned with the learning objectives? Would you use PowerPoint to demonstrate to the children that their pocket money is linked to achievement of the empirical measures at each milestone? Would you conduct an after-action review at the end of the party, update your best practice database and revise standard operating procedures for party management? No! Instead, like most parents, you would create barriers to prevent certain types of behaviour, you would use attractors (party games, a football, a videotape) to encourage the formation of beneficial largely self-organising identities; you would disrupt negative patterns early, to prevent the party becoming chaotic, or necessitating the draconian imposition of authority. At the end of the party you would know whether it had been a success, but you could not have defined (in other than the most general terms) what that success would look like in advance.},

But this definition of philosophy implies a somewhat singular "analytic of the concept," to borrow Kant's phrase. One of the problems it poses is the fact that concepts, from a Deleuzian perspective, have no identity but only a becoming. This paper examines the nature of this problem, arguing that the aim of Deleuze analytic is to introduce the form of time into concepts in terms of what he calls "continuous variation" or "pure variability." The aim is not to rediscover the eternal or the universal, but to find the conditions under which something new is produced (creativeness). PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

However, issues of context have also been important in other areas of human-computer interaction research. I argue that the scope of context-based computing should be extended to include not only ubiquitous computing, but also recent trends in tangible interfaces as well as work on sociological investigations of the organization of interactive behavior. By taking a view of context-aware computing that integrates these different perspectives, we can begin to understand the foundational relations that tie them all together, and that provide a framework for understanding the basic principles behind these various forms of embodied interaction. In particular, I point to phenomenology as a basis for the development of a new framework for design and evaluation of context-aware technologies.},

The quality of story telling and its conformity or otherwise with desired corporate values is one measure of the overall health of an organization. Stories exist in all organizations; managed and purposeful story telling provides a powerful mechanism for the disclosure of intellectual or knowledge assets in companies. It can also provide a non-intrusive, organic means of producing sustainable cultural change; conveying brands and values; transferring complex tacit knowledge. Too many management theories are based on mechanical models of the organization, which fail to recognize that success is best achieved by treating the organization as a complex ecology, whose workings cannot be fully predicted. In this article the use of story telling will be explored in respect of different business purposes. This will provide a pragmatic approach to the use of the age old ability of communities to convey complex knowledge through story telling which will provide readers with tools and concepts that can be readily applied in their own organizations. ¡/p¿},

	issn = {1077-5730},
	abstract = {¡p¿ This paper challenges the assumption of discoverable order inherent in most approaches to strategy. A false dichotomy between order and chaos is removed by the introduction of a third system type, namely a complex system. It is argued that different types of systems require different ways of knowing and acting, and a set of rules for decision making. Organizational structure is identified for each domain or system type. Understanding boundary movements between domains allows us to gain new insight into a variety of subjects such as crisis management and innovation. The use of complexity thinking to provide theoretical rooting for the common-sense actions of strategists is then summarized. For some years the Cynefin Centre has been engaged in an emergent, action research program around strategic and operational decision making. Originating in knowledge management, the applications have now extended to various application areas including organizational change, market intelligence, innovation and strategy. The subjects (and funding) have come principally from the defense and pharmaceutical sectors, but more recently we have seen the involvement of finance, manufacturing and health; indicating a wider acceptance of the ideas and concepts involved. The work has been fundamentally influenced by a variety of sources, but principally complexity theory, narrative and recent thinking about the nature of human decision theory. This paper describes the basic assumptions behind the research, the Cynefin Sense Making framework that has emerged and the implications for strategy in organizations.¡/p¿},

In this article I examine how the philosophy of Deleuze and that of Deleuze and Guattari can help us see some of the most important implications of these debates. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We trace the history of bubble sort, its popularity, and its endurance in the face of pedagogical assertions that code and algorithmic examples used in early courses should be of high quality and adhere to established best practices. This paper is more an historical analysis than a philosophical treatise for the exclusion of bubble sort from books and courses. However, sentiments for exclusion are supported by Knuth [17], "In short, the bubble sort seems to have nothing to recommend it, except a catchy name and the fact that it leads to some interesting theoretical problems." Although bubble sort may not be a best practice sort, perhaps the weight of history is more than enough to compensate and provide for its longevity.},

I then overview the three mentioned notions as well as emphasizing complications, implications and conclusions related to the deployment of these and similar tools. The paper offers a number of suggestions and questions related to the context, time, audience, producer, content, soul, purpose and form of these tools. Such suggestions have great implications within business contexts, where timelines, directions and multidisciplinary tensions can act as ‘interfering agents’, complicating how these tools can be designed and deployed by ethnographers operating within the industry.},

	abstract = {The project has engaged critically and reflectively in a series of investigations through Deleuzean theory and fine art practice. It has explored the functions of the diagram in relation to direct images of time, identifying novel perspectives on these aspects of Deleuzean theory through interconnections and a reciprocally transformative engagement with art practice. The research offers fresh insight into the complicated temporal shifts that become apparent through practice by layering visual and discursive elements. The work is concerned with the interrelation and transformation of different temporalities across surfaces and screens, and is situated in the intersections between text, film and drawing. {\textless}- Text functions in, about and as practice, and theory feeds and folds through processes of making. The interactions between analogue and digital, and the superposition and overlaying of the surfaces of drawings with projection are of particular importance. Digital film projections are traced and drawn, and the resulting layered surfaces are filmed again, repeatedly marked over and superimposed. The research addresses how these complex interrelationships might be understood as time images, and how different functions of the diagram can be seen to activate or make possible these direct perceptions of time. The diagram, in a Deleuzean sense, is characterised by a continual splitting that is simultaneously a divergence. Coming apart just as it runs together, the diagram is a marking out or working through that is provisional, temporal and engages with what is yet to be. The time image is identified as an instance in film where the virtual, or pure past and possibility, is perceived in the present. A stable, interwoven structure is developed through Bergson's theories of perception, recognition and memory, and this acts as a surface across, on and within which the main body of the text takes place. This is separated into three parts and each section proposes the interrelationship of a different diagrammatic function and a particular imaging of time. These are seen to arise through: slips, or loose, errant linkages; splits, or simultaneous bifurcations between},

	abstract = {Postmodernism is often used as the signifier for the fashionable drift into relativism and unseriousness within Western philosophy. Conference after conference, article after article, book after book have appeared describing, denouncing or celebrating the postmodern condition. Within in this context, critical realism has, by and large, positioned itself against the postmodern turn. This project re-evaluates this stance. Against the critiques which have been levelled at postmodernism I will argue that critical realism is theoretically best placed to mediate the various postmodern positions and concerns by developing a reading of critical realism which places critical realism firmly within the context of postmodernism as an alternate postmodernism. Yet if critical realism can be understood within postmodernism, postmodernism can equally be understood within a more encompassing, more mediated realism. The task then is to find a new language which brings together Apollo and Dionysus, moving towards perspectival realism and a scientific anarchism concerned with the possibility and limitations of representing a complex world characterised by intensity, difference and becoming.},

	abstract = {Computing systems can function as augmentation of individual humans as well as of human societies. In this contribution, we take mirror worlds as a conceptual blueprint to envision future smart environments in which the physical and the virtual layers are blended into each other. We suggest that pervasive computing technologies can be used to create a coupling between these layers, so that actions or, more generally, events in the physical layer would have an effect in the virtual layer and viceversa. On top of this, wearable technologies and augmented reality techniques enable new forms of user interaction with the smart environment and with other users. Mirror worlds so conceived will enable temporal, individual, and social augmentations. We conclude by elaborating on some possible consequences at the societal level.},

	abstract = {This paper makes a theoretical case for using these two systems approaches together. The theoretical and methodological assumptions of system dynamics (SD) and soft system methodology (SSM) are briefly described and a partial critique is presented. SSM generates and represents diverse perspectives on a problem situation and addresses the socio-political elements of an intervention. However, it is weak in ensuring `dynamic coherence'. consistency between the intuitive behaviour resulting from proposed changes and behaviour deduced from ideas on causal structure. Conversely, SD examines causal structures and dynamic behaviours. However, whilst emphasising the need for a clear issue focus, it has little theory for generating and representing diverse issues. Also, there is no theory for facilitating sensitivity to socio-political elements. A synthesis of the two called ‘Holon Dynamics' is proposed. After an SSM intervention, a second stage continues the socio-political analysis and also operates within a new perspective which values dynamic coherence of the mental construct - the holon - which is capable of expressing the proposed changes. A model of this holon is constructed using SD and the changes are thus rendered `systemically desirable' in the additional sense that dynamic consistency has been confirmed. The paper closes with reflections on the proposal and the need for theoretical consistency when mixing tools is emphasised.},

	abstract = {Creativity research is a large and varied field in which the subject is characterized on many different levels. The arrival of digital media and computational tools has opened up new possibilities for creative practice. The cutting edge in the digital arts is a highly fertile ground for the investigation of creativity and the role of new technologies. The demands of such work often reveal the limitations of existing technologies and open the door to developing new approaches and techniques. This provides the creativity researcher with opportunities to understand the multi-dimensional characteristics of the creative process. At the same time, it places new demands upon the creators of the technological solutions and pushes forward our understanding of the future requirements of creative technologies. This paper is concerned with the nature of creativity and the design of creativity enhancing computer systems. The research has multi-disciplinary foundations in human–computer interaction and creative practice in Art, Design, Science and Engineering. As a result of a series of studies of creative people and the associated developments in technology, a strategy for practice-based research has evolved in which research and practice are interdependent activities that have mutual benefits as well as distinctive outcomes. This paper charts the development of that co-evolutionary process from the foundation studies to recent outcomes of a major project in art and technology collaboration. The notion of the Studio as a laboratory in the field is introduced and a new methodology for systematic practice-based research is presented. From the results of the investigations that took place, opportunities for the development of technology environments for creative collaboration are proposed.},

The cameras roll as Gibson talks about his own personal philosophies, experiences, and opinions about the media-saturated culture in which we live. The conversation provides a compelling glimpse at the radical, genius writer whose 1984 novel NEUROMANCER forever changed the concept of the Internet, propelling the author to the forefront of the media explosion of the late 20th Century. Neale, a music video director, employs hyper speed editing and jarring visuals that combines various media images with excerpts of Gibson's novels, conveying a conceptual journey through the unchartered territory of William Gibson's mind. This slick and stylish visual trip also features interviews with writers Jack Womack and Bruce Sterling, readings from U2's Bono and The Edge, and music from Tomandandy.},

	abstract = {Does systems theory need rethinking? Most social scientists would probably say no. It had its run, was debated critically, and found wanting. If at all, it should be treated historically. Why then might systems theory need rethinking, as the title of this symposium claims? The reason is that, unlike in the natural and biosocial sciences, any conception of system in the social sciences has remained suspect in the wake of problematic Parsonian and cybernetic systems theories. The premise of this special issue is that abandoning conceptions of systems has imposed a high price on the social sciences: a lack of ontologies and methodologies that are both philosophically profound and scientifically defensible. It has left social scientists who choose to ignore ontology in their theoretical and empirical work defenseless against enterprising settlers from a variety of humanities and social science disciplines who attack mainstream work with—often simplistic and naïve, but nevertheless fundamental—philosophical arguments, whether anti-scientific postmodernists or pseudo-scientific rational choice theorists. The goal of this special issue is to showcase new and original work that contributes to a rethinking of systems theory by taking the conception of systems seriously. This introduction offers a programmatic statement of a systemic ontology and methodology as well as a brief general outline and examples of what a systems-based approach in the social sciences entails.},

For emergentism, the core problems of systems thinking are concerned with causation and reductionism; for Luhmann, they are questions of meaning and self-reference. Arguing from an emergentist perspective, the article finds that emergentism addresses its own core problem successfully, while Luhmann's approach is incapable of resolving questions of causation and reductionism. On the other hand, neither paradigm yet has a convincing response to the challenges of meaning and self-reference.},

Following that line of reasoning, I now conclude that intentional action consists in a trajectory whereby emergent, second-order contextual constraints of conscious, dynamical brain organization selectively constrain lower-dimensional motor and speech processes. And these constraints do so in virtue of the meaningful and conative properties of the intentions that they embody. Constrained by such top-down commands, individual motor and speech processes are regulated such that the resulting behavior preserves the dynamic organization that embodies the intention's content. As is the case with all structured structuring structures, intentions are thus causally effective by constraining (entraining) their components in a manner homologous to the way in which the virtual governor of a beam of coherent laser light synchronizes or slaves the random...},

Juarrero then proposes a new framework for conceptualizing causes based on complex adaptive systems. Thinking of causes as dynamical constraints makes bottom-up and top-down causal relations, including those involving intentional causes, suddenly tractable. A different logic for explaining actions - as historical narrative, not inference - follows if one adopts this novel approach to long-standing questions of action and responsibility."–BOOK JACKET.},

	abstract = {The rise of top-heavy inequality—earnings concentration in a very thin layer of elites—calls into question our understanding of the distributional effects of the Liberal International Order. Far more people lose from globalization, and fewer gain, than traditional economic models suggest. We review three modern trade theories (neo-Heckscher-Ohlin-Stolper-Samuelson or H-O-S-S, new new trade theory, and economic geography) that each arrive at the conclusion of top-heavy inequality by introducing some form of unit heterogeneity—an assumption that the actors we once treated as identical actually differ from one another in important ways. Heterogeneity allows the gains from globalization to concentrate in a narrow segment of workers with superlative talents, extraordinarily productive firms, or heavily agglomerated cities. An analysis of European voting data shows that shocks from trade and migration elicit populist opposition only where the top 1 percent have gained the most. With few politically feasible alternatives to protectionism, most notably the failure of democracies to redistribute income, our analysis predicts a persistence of public support for antiglobalization parties, especially those on the Right.},

Rethinking realism after Roland Barthes' “The Death of the Author” (1967) requires a special kind of labor: allegedly, an anachronistic task of recuperating representation as a concept that is meaningful and even “possible.” Noticing the new literary practices of modernist masters such as Mallarmé, Valéry, and Proust, Barthes made a declarative argument in his essay that a text “could have no other origin than language itself,” turning the autonomy of the art object into the autonomy of the text, thus extending aesthetic autonomy to all of language.1 His claim that searching for an ultimate, single meaning in a text entails…},

Featuring contributions from 44 scholars across a variety of disciplines, the collection is divided into five parts: Connecting Literature and Politics; Constituting the Polis; Periods and Histories; Media, Genre, and Techne; and Spaces. Organized around familiar concepts—such as humans, animals, workers, empires, nations, and states—rather than theoretical schools, it will help readers to understand the ways in which literature affects our understanding of who is capable of political action, who has been included in and excluded from politics, and how different spaces are imagined to be political. It also offers a series of engagements with key moments in literary and political history from 1066 to the present in order to assess and reassess the utility of conventional modes of periodization. The book extends current discussions in the area, looking at cutting-edge developments in the discipline of literary studies, which will appeal to academics and researchers seeking to orient their own interventions within broader contexts.},

Bringing formalist analysis and affect theory to bear on one another, recent works of literary, art, and film criticism by C. Namwali Serpell, renée c. hoogland, and Eugenie Brinkema develop methodologies for exploring how the arts move us — how they impress themselves upon our bodies and create effects in the world. Adding to the current conversation about postcritical reading, surface reading, distant reading, and other methodological developments, these works offer methods for illuminating the relationship between form and feeling: neo-phenomenology, retelling, and close reading. By analyzing the relationship between affect and aesthetics across genres of art, this essay argues, we can expand the category of reading to better understand the temporal, spatial, and sensory encounter between text and audience.},

	abstract = {This thesis is an analysis of the structure and operation of the artistic system of the Yolungu people who live in the Yirrkala region of North-east Arnhem Land, Australia. The analysis is approached from a semiological perspective examining Yolngu art as a system of encoded meaning. The thesis is divided into three main sections. In the first section I examine in detail the social context of art, focusing on the distribution of rights in paintings, the operation of the artistic system in the context of Yolngu politics, the instrumental functions of art objects in ceremonial contexts and their integration within the thematic structure of ceremonies as a whole. The second section consists of an analysis of the structure of the artistic system. I identify and define the components if the artistic system, considering them from a semantic perspective. I consider in particular the properties of the two main systems of representation employed in Yolnga art, one figurative, the other geometric, demonstrating the different ways in which the components are combined to produce different categories of painting with different semantic properties. I show how the paintings are appropriate to the different contexts in which they occur. I consider the functioning of the artistic system in the context of a system of restricted knowledge. Throughout the section I consider the appropriateness of the concept of iconicity as a basis for understanding the relationships between signifier and signified within the system. The third section examines in detail the iconography of the paintings of a single clan, the Manggalili. I show the relationship between different levels of meaning are encoded in the same meaning is encoded in different paintings. In conclusion I consider the sense in which paintings have power such that they are believed to be able to communicate between the human and the ancestral world and also the ways in which paintings enhance the believability of ancestral beings. I show that rather than there being a single source of power Yolngu art has a multiplicity of power sources. The power is derived from the different ways in which the artistic system us integrated with other aspects of the Yolngu socio-cultural system as well as from the potentialities of the artistic system itself.},

But the biology of the XX century studies common genotype features, inherited to the whole animated matter, as genetic code, protein-folding, etc. Traditional theory of art might be compared to phenotype studies in biology, whereas complexity theory of art, to genotype studies.},

	abstract = {Downward causation is the controversial idea that ‘higher’ levels of organization can causally influence behaviour at ‘lower’ levels of organization. Here I propose that we can gain traction on downward causation by being operational and examining how adaptive systems identify regularities in evolutionary or learning time and use these regularities to guide behaviour. I suggest that in many adaptive systems components collectively compute their macroscopic worlds through coarse-graining. I further suggest we move from simple feedback to downward causation when components tune behaviour in response to estimates of collectively computed macroscopic properties. I introduce a weak and strong notion of downward causation and discuss the role the strong form plays in the origins of new organizational levels. I illustrate these points with examples from the study of biological and social systems and deep neural networks. This article is part of the themed issue ‘Reconceptualizing the origins of life’.},

	abstract = {Empirical aesthetics and neuroaesthetics study two main issues: the valuation of sensory objects and art experience. These two issues are often treated as if they were intrinsically interrelated: Research on art experience focuses on how art elicits aesthetic pleasure, and research on valuation focuses on special categories of objects or emotional processes that determine the aesthetic experience. This entanglement hampers progress in empirical aesthetics and neuroaesthetics and limits their relevance to other domains of psychology and neuroscience. Substantial progress in these fields is possible only if research on aesthetics is disentangled from research on art. We define aesthetics as the study of how and why sensory stimuli acquire hedonic value. Under this definition, aesthetics becomes a fundamental topic for psychology and neuroscience because it links hedonics (the study of what hedonic valuation is in itself) and neuroeconomics (the study of how hedonic values are integrated into decision making and behavioral control). We also propose that this definition of aesthetics leads to concrete empirical questions, such as how perceptual information comes to engage value signals in the reward circuit or why different psychological and neurobiological factors elicit different appreciation events for identical sensory objects.},

	shorttitle = {Visualizing {Feeling}},
	abstract = {Is late modern art 'anti-aesthetic'? What does it mean to label a piece of art 'affectless'? These traditional characterizations of 1960s and 1970s art are radically challenged in this subversive art history. By introducing feeling to the analysis of this period, Susan Best acknowledges the radical and exploratory nature of art in late modernism. The book focuses on four highly influential female artists--Eva Hesse, Lygia Clark, Ana Mendieta and Theresa Hak Kyung Cha--and it explores how their art transformed established avant-garde protocols by introducing an affective dimension. This aspect of their work, while often noted, has never before been analyzed in detail. Visualizing Feeling also addresses a methodological blind spot in art history: the interpretation of feeling, emotion and affect. It demonstrates that the affective dimension, alongside other materials and methods of art, is part of the artistic means of production and innovation. This is the first thorough re-appraisal of aesthetic engagement with affect in post-1960s art.},

	abstract = {The cultural project is a therapeutic melding of emotion, symbols, and knowledge. In this paper, I describe how spiritual emotions engendered through encounters in imaginative culture enable fixation of metaphysical beliefs. Evolved affective systems are domesticated through the social practices of imaginative culture so as to adapt people to live in culturally defined cooperative groups. Conditioning, as well as tertiary-level cognitive capacities such as symbols and language are enlisted to bond groups through the imaginative formats of myth and participatory ritual. These cultural materializations can be shared by communities both synchronically and diachronically in works of art. Art is thus a form of self-knowledge that equips us with a motivated understanding of ourselves in the world. In the sacred state produced through the arts and in religious acts, the sense of meaning becomes noetically distinct because affect infuses the experience of immanence, and one's memory of it, with salience. The quality imbued thereby makes humans attentive to subtle signs and broad “truths.” Saturated by emotions and the experience of alterity in the immanent encounter of imaginative culture, information made salient in the sacred experience can become the basis for belief fixation. Using examples drawn from mimetic arts and arts of immanence, I put forward a theory about how sensible affective knowledge is mediated through affective systems, direct perception, and the imagination.},

	abstract = {As the world moves forward into the twenty first century, change is inevitable. Through an investigation highlighting the benefits of an arts education, this research intends to document the power of the visual image in our world both past and present. The study will be evaluating the value and power of an arts education in today's transforming climate. The visual arts will be acknowledged as a vehicle for enhancing life beyond its aesthetic power, and its ability to illicit emotional connections. Artistic imagery will be investigated for its significant contributions as a messenger for society. A case will be made for a shift in the format of art education, drawing clear support for the adoption of the social reconstructivist perspective on education. This view enables the teacher to reaffirm the adage "knowledge is power," by teaching the theory that art and education through their unified communicative style have the ability to promote social change. The support for embracing this theory will come from the current trends of our culture within the twenty first century. The overall objective of this research is to address the ever present changes that exist within the field of art education, and to embrace the newest suggested model for teaching within the field. Students need to learn how to view visual imagery, how to interpret it, and then ultimately how to use it. Addressing these ideas will move the validation for art education to the forefront of mandatory instruction, and, the twenty first century art students will potentially gain a strong sense of the power of imagery. Consequently, such a shift could pave the way for the use of the visual image in everyday life, possibly even as a vehicle for social change.},

Although all three alternatives reject positivism, they make very different diagnoses of its problems and, therefore, offer very different remedies (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

Results showed a significant negative relationship between phone conscious thought, “how often did you think about your phone”, and memory recall but not for SAS and memory recall. Phone conscious thought significantly predicted memory accuracy. We found that the presence of a smartphone and high phone conscious thought affects one’s memory learning and recall, indicating the negative effect of a smartphone proximity to our learning and memory.},

	abstract = {There is existing evidence on how excessive screen exposure can be detrimental to cognitive health, and in recent years there has been an increase in the usage of mobile phones by adolescents. We aimed to examine the association between mobile phone screen exposure and cognitive function among a young healthy population. We carried out a cross-sectional study conducted in 632 adolescents (13.89 ± 0.52 years old). Exposure data were collected through self-reported questionnaires, and cognitive outcomes were assessed by different computer-based neuropsychological tests. Compared to students in the lowest tertile ({\textless}9 min/day) of mobile phone screen exposure (MPSE), those in the medium tertile (9–20 min/day) showed significantly higher hit reaction time standard error (HRT-SE, higher inattentiveness) = (14.9 ms, 95\% CI = 0.6; 29.3), as did as those in the highest tertile ({\textgreater}20 min/day) = (11.1 ms, 95\% CI = 2.8; 25.0). When adjusting for confounders, the association held for the medium-MPSE tertile (17.6 ms, 95\% CI = 3.4; 31.7). When further adjusting for intermediate factors, an increase in inattentiveness scores was also observed in both groups, with higher HRT-SE values for participants in the medium (15.8 ms, 95\% CI = 1.4; 30.3) and highest MPSE tertiles (14.97 ms, 95\% CI = 0.9; 29.1). There were no significant associations with fluid intelligence or working memory scores. Overall, our study shows that healthy teenagers reporting higher screen exposure may be affected in their attention performance. However, more studies are needed to determine the causality of these associations and to better shape the screen exposure recommended guidelines for brain health during adolescence.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence and associated digital technologies (DTs) have environmental impacts. These include heavy carbon dioxide emissions linked to the energy consumption required to generate and process large amounts of data; extracting minerals for, and manufacturing of, technological components; and e-waste. These environmental impacts are receiving increasing policy and media attention through discourses of environmental sustainability. At the same time, ‘sustainability’ is a complex and nebulous term with a multiplicity of meanings and practices. This paper explores how experts working with DTs understand and utilise the concept of environmental sustainability in their practices. Our research question was how do stakeholders researching, governing or working on the environmental impacts of DTs, utilise environmental sustainability concepts? We applied a combination of bibliometric analysis and 24 interviews with key stakeholders from the digital technology sector. Findings show that, although stakeholders have broad conceptual understandings of the term sustainability and its relation to the environmental impacts of DTs, in practice, environmental sustainability tends to be associated with technology based and carboncentric approaches. While narrowing conceptual understandings of environmental sustainability was viewed to have a practical purpose, it hid broader sustainability concerns. We urge those in the field not to lose sight of the wider ‘ethos of sustainability’.},

From defacing corporate logos to erecting geofenced digital monuments, more and more people are creating AR experiences for social causes. We sought to understand this new form of activism, including why people use AR for these purposes, opportunities and challenges in using it, and how well it can support activist goals. We conducted semi-structured interviews with twenty people involved in projects that used AR for a social cause across six different countries. We found that AR can overcome physical world limitations of activism to convey immersive, multilayered narratives that aim to reveal invisible histories and perspectives. At the same time, people experienced challenges in creating, maintaining, and distributing their AR experiences to audiences. We discuss open questions and opportunities for creating AR tools and experiences for social change.},
